# Reveal.js Build System

This is a build system for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) that helps (i) create a presentation from a set of markdown files, and (ii) makes it easy to upgrade to the latest version of `reveal.js`.

It makes upgrading to the latest version of reveal.js as easy as running `git submodule update --remote`, and creates a `dist` directory with all the necessary files to run your presentation.
